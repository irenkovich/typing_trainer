### Typing trainer 

This repo contains code for training typing in the terminal.
Initially, it was made for my girlfriend to learn type in Russian in blind, because her new keyboard doesn't contain Russian at all. :)
But it can be easily be reworked for other languages/type of texts.

By changing src/data/content.txt you will change values to type.
By changing src/data/hints.txt you will change hints showed up by backspace pressing.
